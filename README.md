# Checking PR bodies and diffs for words, and number of files and lines in files changed.

Based on the [actions TS template](https://github.com/actions/typescript-template), we'll try to create a new action. This new action will check for the presence of a word in the body or diff in a PR. It uses the GitHub API, so you'll need to provide a token. Don't worry, that's built-in.

# Using this action

You would need to put this in a file in `.github/workflows`

```
name: "Check PR for word"
on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  check_pr:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Check PR
      uses: JJ/github-pr-contains-action@releases/v0
      with:
        github-token: ${{github.token}}
        bodyDoesNotContain: "Delete this"
        bodyContains: 'Test'
        diffContains: 'Test'
        filesChanged: 1
        linesChanged: 1
```

The `bodyContains` variable will include the string that we want the body of the PR to include, such as checked items in a checklist; obviously `bodyDoesNotContain` will hold the opposite, what we don't want to see in the PR body.

They can be left empty if no check wants to be done.

An example is used as [.github/workflows/check-PRs-here.yaml](.github/workflows/check-PRs-here.yaml) in this repository.
